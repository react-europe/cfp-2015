    React.js and Flux are revolutionizing the front-end web development world.
    However, the ecosystem is still very immature. This talk will cover useful
    techniques for adapting existing jQuery plugins and other legacy browser
    libraries to properly implement React.js component specifications and
    lifecycle methods. Live on the wild side and fill the library gap!
