  Title: Keeping it simple: React & just a spreadsheet
  Description: >
    Imagine a searchable product list* with a few thousand items to
    manage that uses only a spreadsheet as its database.

    In this talk I'll describe the recipe used to build HasGluten,
    an up-to-date and comprehensive list of gluten-free foods 
    maintained in 5 languages.

    Take a Google spreadsheet as a backend, query it via JSON API.
    Add a React web app as a frontend. To your taste, render
    server-side. Host the static web pages on GitHub.

    The result is a cheap, scalable, geo-distributed software stack,
    with simple interfaces to maintain both code (GitHub Pages) and
    data (Google Sheets -- also great for the non-tech).

    I'll show relevant pieces of code (all open source**) and explain
    how React's "easy to reason" philosophy enables such a resource
    effective solution -- extremely low cost, little time to setup,
    and simple maintenance.

    Bonus takeaway: learn how we translated 1k+ foods in 5 languages!
