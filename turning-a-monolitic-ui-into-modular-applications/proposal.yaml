  Title: How we turned a monolitic UI into multiple modular applications
  Description: >
    React.js is **not** cool.
    Spending efforts to convince people wary about the hype is not cool either.
    Spending less time chasing bugs **is** cool.

    I spent 3 afternoons to break up an existing Web application into npm packages and demoed our visual atoms as an autonomous living styleguide.
    When I have been asked how I achieved this so quickly: I answered I created and assembled React.js components.

    Developing new features became faster than one would expect.
    The time spent in code reviews and maintenance time diminished as well.
    And even better: now, our UI designers test and prototype their ideas right into the components. They only have to type `npm start` to see their work reflected in their Web browser.
    
    This talk relates this migration journey:
    - breaking up a common problem through incremental improvement
    - elevating the browserify pipeline to a first class citizen
    - making our interface and components reusable by default
    - building and integrating our shiny components in non-browserified applications

    Basically, this is a story on how I turned *frustrated* developers into *happy* composers pairing with UI designers.
