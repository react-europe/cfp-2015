  Title: Share your component with the outside world
  Description: >
	Your component is the best thing since sliced bread. To boost your ego, you want to share it with the outside world.
	But what extra requirements should your component comply with? What do other developers expect?
	
	Users will have many questions: Where do I find the component? Can I test-drive? What is the default behaviour? 
	How can I change this behaviour? Are there events I can handle? How do I style the component? 
	Does it have the same browser requirements as React or doesn't it run on IE8? What properties are supported? 
	Where is the state kept? Does the license suit me?
	
	This talk offers you a checklist to prepare your components for the big bad world. From conventions to follow to 
	providing the required flexibility. From defining the properties and their types to publishing the component on NPM. 
	Of course all answers to the questions above will be covered.
	
	Prevent your ego from getting hurt!
