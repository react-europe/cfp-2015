  Title: Reusable Business Logic Using JSX
  Description: >
    Wouldn't it be great if you could reuse and configure your business 
    logic the same way you configure React components?

    Learn how we built a framework for building models containing 
    reusable business logic that can be configured using JSX tags, then
    reconfigured using new props during the model lifecycle.

    The model framework we'll discuss will let you:
    
     - Configure models using JSX
     - Leverage the propTypes validation of React
     - Pass props down through nested model components
     - Design stateless models that rely only on props
     - Use models deterministically across multiple React components
    
    From color schemes & data pipelines to spell checkers & routers,
    using a component architecture lets you reuse your business logic
    across and within applications. Then, using JSX for configuration, 
    you can design your applications declaratively, not 
    programatically.
