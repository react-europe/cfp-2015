  Title: An Elm-inspired React architecture
  Description: >
    Elm is a FRP language that compiles to Javascript. It’s creator, Evan
    Czaplicki, writes about a really simple pattern that naturally emerged when
    creating apps with Elm, that’s surprisingly powerful, here:
    https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial. Moreover, Elm’s
    redering technique uses vdom, which is inspired in turn by React. Should we
    come full circle?
    In this talk, we’ll explain this architecture and explore how to bring it
    back to Javascript land using React, Immutable.js and the Flux dispatcher to
    provide a new way to create complex UIs. No need for using Stores, cursors
    or learn new concepts. If you know React and functions, you got all you
    need!
