  Title: Maintainability: To Mixin or not to Mixin
  Description: >
    With the increasing size of our JavaScript applications, maintainability becomes a significant factor. For this
    reason React's functional approach is becoming popular.

    Do not repeat yourself (DRY) is a software development best practise to improve maintainability. We can use
    inheritance, composition, mixins or other techniques to achieve this. In the original React class system
    mixins were very popular. With the introduction of ES6 classes in React v0.13, mixins are no longer possible.

    This talk explains the different DRY approaches, the pros and cons and their application in React. For example,
    we'll see how (multiple) mixins and React classes are combined. By diving into React's source, we can see
    what's possible and what's not. Composition with ES6 classes will also be extensively explored and demoed,
    whenever possible with the new compositional API.

    This session aims to help you write maintainable React apps.
