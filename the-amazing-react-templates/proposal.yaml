  Title: The Amazing React-Templates!
  Description: >
    React-Templates is a lightweight, yet amazingly powerful templating engine for ReactJS. It compiles into ReactJS
    code. No runtime libraries. No magic. Has an HTML like syntax. Leads to absolute separation of presentation and 
    logic and produces runtime HTML that is nearly identical to the template. 
    I will tell the love story between WiX.com and ReactJS. Why JSX just didn't feel right to us and how we came to create 
    the React-Templates project. We will then glide into a more technical discussion, complete with code examples: 
    * The basic concepts. * Hello World template and the Javascript it compiles into. * Flow control directives: rt-if 
    and rt-repeat. * Variable scoping with rt-scope. * The rt-props, style and rt-class directive. 
    * Component composition with rt-require. * Event handlers and the built in lambda notation. And sum it up with a 
    full blown example with interdependent components goodness.
