  Title: Dawn of the Progressive Single Page App
  Description: >
    With the increasing popularity of single page applications, we've seemingly
    been forced to choose between progressive enhancement and rich, app-like
    experiences on the web. Thanks to React and Node.js, we now have the ability
    to share our UI code between client and server, allowing us to get the best
    of both worlds by pre-rendering on the server. While extremely powerful, this
    technique only serves to highlight why progressive enhancement continues to
    be such a vital approach to web development. After beginning with a refresher
    course in progressive enhancement, we'll cover the ways in which we can ensure
    our React applications remain crawlable, accessible and resilient, even when
    JavaScript is completely disabled.
