  Title: "Movin Out: Migrating a Legacy jQuery Salesforce App to React"
  Description: >
    Migrating an enterprise software app across multiple JavaScript frameworks can be challenging. 
    This session will cover learning React while migrating an existing, mostly jQuery based, JavaScript 
    application. In addition, we’ll also explore the unique considerations in converting an existing 
    app on a third party platform to React.

    First, we’ll review the constraints specific to enterprise apps operating on the Salesforce
    platform, including stringent requirements for reliability, predictability, end-customer customization,
    and end-user experience.  

    Next, we’ll describe dev environment configuration on a third party platform. This will include a discussion
    of peculiarities involved in development when you do not control the full DOM.

    Finally we will transition to a hands on demo of slicing an existing app into React components, 
    as well as building the stores to feed them. With a completed app, we will explore performance 
    optimizations and troubleshooting.
