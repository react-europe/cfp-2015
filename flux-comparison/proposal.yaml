  Title: Flux Comparison by Example
  Description: >
    Nowadays there are too much Flux libraries on the web. That's why it's hard to choose
    the most suitable one for your next project.

    This talk aims to be a helpful practical comparison of modern Flux solutions.
    We will take a closer look on the implementation differencies, support of isomorphism,
    API simplicity and how the libraries cope with boilerplate code. We will see what patterns
    such libraries as Alt.js, Flummox or Reflux borrow from the original Facebook Flux.
    Good comparison is achieved by following the implementation details of one demo application
    developed with different Flux frameworks.
