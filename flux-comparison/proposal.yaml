  Title: Flux Comparison by Example
  Description: >
    Nowadays there are too much of Flux libraries on the web. Sometimes it's
    hard to choose the most suited one for your next project but this talk aims
    to be a helpful practical comparison of modern Flux solutions. We will take
    a closer look on the implementation differencies, support of isomorphism,
    API simplicity and patterns such libraries like Alt and Flummox borrow
    from original Facebook Flux through one example application developed with
    different Flux frameworks.
