  Title: My awesome talk
  Description: >
    React is great for building fast UI. React-Canvas and React-Native are taking it to new paradigms. But what about the good old DOM? With transforms, requestAnimationFrame and some discipline you can create amazing animations with React.
    Famo.us is framework built specifically for buildning great animations in the DOM. When you look deeper it has it own version of a virtual DOM to accomplish this. I will who how you can plug Famo.us in a React App. How React can be made to work more like famo.us, and you build complicated layouts with smooth animations in React.
    Upclose.me is a 100% React app and uses these concepts in production. There will be some code examples.
    The talk will end with some 'hype'-like demos for amazing animations in React.
