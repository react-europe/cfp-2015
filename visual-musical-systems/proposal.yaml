Session:
  Title: Visual Musical Systems With React
  Description: >
    In React you model your app as a tree of components. Data flows down through
    the tree to update your app. The Web Audio API enables you to create sound
    by building a graph of AudioNodes. Singlals flow through the graph, are
    modified at each node, and comes out your speakers. These two things are
    very similar! React is a great fit for building a music creation tool.

    Learn the basics of the Web Audio API, and how we can use React to make and
    visualize music in the browser. Along the way we'll talk about unique
    strategies for component communication, and together we will compose and
    perform The Song Of React.
