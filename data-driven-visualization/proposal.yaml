  Title: Data-Driven Visualization
  Description: >
    D3 is the prime library for building DOM-based visualizations. In addition to a vast collection of functions for manipulating data, it provides a way of describing the DOM in a data-driven and declarative way. However, D3 does not help much with state management, creating reusable components and well-structured applications. React and Flux to the rescue! I will talk about how React and D3 are similar in spirit, where they are fundamentally different, and how this combo can be leveraged to build great and maintainable data-driven visualizations.
