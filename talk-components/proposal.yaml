Session:
  Title: Components architecture for the search era
  Description: >
    One of the promises of React is to give the ability to build reusable components.
    But let's admit it, we're not always the end-user of those components. What do you have
    to do to actually build components that will help others without getting in
    their way? How do you create the perfect mix between flexibility and ease of
    use? And how do you make your components so that they are able to communicate
    with each other without imposing too much?

    At Algolia, we make a search engine as a service, and a pretty fast one. We
    want our users to feel the speed and create a UX benefiting from it.
    In practice this means building a whole interface that is able to update itself instantaneously in
    response to the user input and all the search information we retrieve from the
    server. The sprectrum of UX that one can wish to implement goes from the simple
    autocomplete to the multi facet exploration of the results and to even fancier experience.

    This talk will present what solutions we came up with for making a set of consistent
    and communicating components, that can be used by everyone. All that, in the
    hope of enabling them to unleash the navigation experience of their own users
    and enter the SEARCH ERA.
