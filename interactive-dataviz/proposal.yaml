Session:
  Title: Interactive Data Visualization
  Description: >
    Users today want more than to simply visualize their data, they 
    want to inspect and manipulate their data to gain new insights.
    
    Learn how to use React to build interactive data visualization apps
    that allow a user to highlight, inspect, select, filter and drill 
    into their data by directly manipulating a data visualization. 
    
    In this talk, we'll explore how to:
    
     - Build a data pipeline to manage data manipulation
     - Create frameworks to manage focus, selection, zoom & filters
     - Develop simple data visualization components that inherit 
       interactivity from these frameworks
     - Inject context menus and mouse & keyboard controllers into these
       visualizations
     
    This talk will teach you the lessons we've learned building Amaze, 
    a data visualization & discovery SDK built entirely on React.
