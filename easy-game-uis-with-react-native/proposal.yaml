  Title: Easy Game UIs with React Native
  Description: >
    React Native provides a good compromise for making native apps with a workflow similar to the web.
    It's pretty easy to integrate React Native with any 2d or 3d game, and with the Cmd+R refresh
    workflow combined with the declarative component style, it just became incredibly easy to make
    game UIs!

    I will dive into various strategies to integrate React Native with games. I will show how to
    sync up the UI with game state, and go into details of the JavaScript and Objective-C bridge.
