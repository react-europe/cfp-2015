  Title: Inline Styles: themes, media queries, contexts, and when it's best to use CSS
  Description: >
    React allows you to write styles inline and bypass a host of CSS shortcomings. Scope, dependency management, dead code elimination, these problems go away when adding your styles directly to components. But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Things like theming and media queries become much more difficult when all your styles live directly on components. In this talk, we'll look at how to solve these problems with contexts and plain old JavaScript. We'll also look at the roll of container-components and when it's better to "just use CSS."
