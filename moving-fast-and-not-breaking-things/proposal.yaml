Session:
  Title: Moving fast and not breaking things
  Description: >
    Hear a report from the frontlines of using React.js to build products at
    breakneck speed at a SaaS startup.

    Kyle is the technical cofounder at [RelateRocket](https://relaterocket.co)
    which enables salespeople to create adhoc micropages to send personalized marketing
    content to buyers.

    In this session Kyle will discuss the theory and practices that helps them
    quickly and reliably ship new code and bug fixes to their six and counting
    internal/external React applications.

    Learn why and how you should:

    * Invest heavily in open source. React.js is unique in the history of the web
    that it finally enables highly reusable components. Adopting and contributing to
    open source speeds development velocity and makes your code more reliable.
    * Invest in adopting and building development tools.
    * Automate builds and make immutable deployments.
    * Test and monitor code using visual diffing and other strategies.
