  Title: React: Challenging the Status Quo
  Description: >
    I started using JavaScript when it was merely five years old. At that time
    DOM APIs weren't yet hardened. There wasn't even a consistent way to find
    an element across all browsers. We didn't have Ajax for retrieving data
    from the server. We didn't use fancy CSS layouts. We didn't event have
    JavaScript frameworks. Back then single page apps weren't just unheard of,
    they were impossible.

    In the early 2000s we used tables for layout. If you wanted to load parts
    of your page asynchronously you used framesets. JavaScript was mostly used
    to validate forms, and handle image rollovers. Every link, and every form
    submission resulted in a full page reload. We may scoff at that now, but
    these were the best practices of the time.

    Web development has evolved a lot over the years. A lot of the things that
    we take for granted now, were once significant break throughs at the time.
    Innovation happens when we refuse to be satisfied with the status quo.
    
    This talk will review some of the history of web development. Then we'll
    look at how React is making developers rethink what is currently accepted
    as best practices.
