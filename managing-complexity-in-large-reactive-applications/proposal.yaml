  Title: Managing complexity in large reactive applications
  Description: >
    React has changed how we develop user interfaces, but there are
    lots of competing ideas about how the rest of the application
    should interact. We faced this when building our presentation tool
    using React. It needs to handle lots of state, complex mouse
    interactions and communication with our canvas renderer. Not to
    mention the fact that users expect our app to support
    Google Docs-style collaboration and so we also have to react to
    changes from the network seamlessly.
    
    To manage this complexity we tried using OOP, Flux, FRP (Bacon.js)
    and we even tried reimplementing parts in Elm.
    In this talk I will show you what we learned and how we decided
    to mix architectures. I will demonstrate how they interact
    while taking advantage of centralized state and pure functions to
    make code easier to understand and test.
