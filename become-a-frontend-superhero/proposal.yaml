Session:
  Title: Become a frontend superhero 
  Description: >
    Superheros aren't born, they're made. Discover how you can become
    a superhero by discovering and using the powers that are available
    to you as a frontend developer.
    This is a pumped up, feel-good talk that takes you from zero to hero. 
    We'll start with a blinking cursor on the command line, and end up with a 
    superpowered React app.
