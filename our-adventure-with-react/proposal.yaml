  Title: Our Adventure with React.js
  Description: >
    As a Director of Cloud Services for Avi-on (http://avi-on.com) I am in
    charge of the definition of the overall architecture of our Cloud Services.
    These Services support the information that we sync accross smartphones and
    the metrics we store to know how users consume our services.
    When it was time to build our admin interface, we took the simplest approach:
    using static views generated on the server. As our Admin application grew
    and became more complex, we understood it was time for a change.
    That was when we decided to use React.js and this is the story of what we had
    to resolve in order to ship our application to production:

    * Choosing the correct Archicture (Flux vs no Flux vs Reflux vs ...)
    * Reaching limitations of the Architecture * Fetching and Storing Data from the server
    * External Components * Team collaboration in a component-based world.
    * Scaling React. * Thinking about how React.js would help us achieve our vision.
