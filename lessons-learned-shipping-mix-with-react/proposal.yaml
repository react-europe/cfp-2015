  Title: Lessons learned shipping Mix
  Description: >
    FiftyThree creates tools (Paper, Pencil, Mix) to make creativity accessible
    to everyone. In the fall of 2014, we shipped our web service and client Mix
    which enables collaborative creation (mix.fiftythree.com).
    What you may not know, is that Mix was a backbone app three short months
    before shipping. This talk will focus on porting, building, shipping, and
    continuing to grow a live React app with a large user base. Mix is an
    isomorphic JS app running on a node.js backend taking advantage of Reactâ€™s
    server side rendering.
    Mix, as the web client sister to the app Paper for iPad, uses React to
    render a very design driven experience. Topics of focus will include
    breaking down our component design for optimistic view rendering, creating
    and using SVG react components, building out our client side graph cache
    with React state, and issues we encountered in the weeks before shipping
    (and how we solved them).
