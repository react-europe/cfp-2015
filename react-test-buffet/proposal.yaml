  Title: Testing React components the right way
  Description: >
    Did you ever introduce a mistake in the `render()` method and have your
    tests that check the callbacks fail? Did you ever introduce a mistake in one
    of your component's children and have the parent's tests fail? Is your test
    suite slow and to work around it you only run part of it?

    I answered yes to all of those questions a while ago and I was very
    frustrated. So I decided to rewrite our testing framework from the ground
    up. We managed to transition from slow running integrated tests to fast
    highly focused tests. Now when a mistake is introduced into a component,
    only the relevant tests fail and we immediately know where to debug.

    In this presentation I'll talk about the theory of collaboration and
    contract tests and how we can apply it to React components. I'll then delve
    into the techniques we use to write tests that only check the behaviour that
    we want to check.
