  Title: Engineering for search
  Description: >
    On June 15, 2006, a very special verb was added to the Oxford English
    dictionary. It describes the act of looking for a product, a service, or
    information to satsify a need, a desire, or a curiosity. It has become the
    rallying cry of a networked public. Next time someone invokes it – “let me
    google that!” – will you appear?

    Engineering plays a major role in closing the gap between a search and your
    product. This back-to-first-principles talk will explore what makes the web
    so well suited to answer the kinds of questions your customers are asking,
    will detail why semantics matter, will deconstruct the steps between the
    inception of a thought and a conversion on your site, and will show how to
    engineer for search using React.

    With comScore estimating that over 1.5 billion unique people use a search
    engine to find what they're looking for every month, can you afford not to
    be engineering for search? I wouldn't chance it.

  bio: >
    I build web and mobile applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and
    Objective-C. En-route to becoming a programmer, I made stops at graphic
    design school and my local university's math department; experiences which
    have served me well in the area of client-side application development.

    I have the pleasure of working with a world-class team building web
    interfaces at Instagram, and I teach React at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park.
