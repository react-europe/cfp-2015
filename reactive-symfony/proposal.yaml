  Title: Reactive symfony
  Description: >
    When you are working in an already-running environment it's not easy to 
    incorporate a totally new technology, especially when your backend technology 
    is based on a different language. You have to deal with complicated security 
    and performance issues and you can quickly realize there are no existing tools 
    to help you resolve problems you’re facing.
    This presentation is a full blown example of React.js integration into 
    an existing project, using PHP and one of its best framework Symfony 2. 
    In this step-by-step guide I’ll show you how to approach most difficult 
    parts of the whole process. From architectural decision, through server side 
    integration with well-established framework components in bilingual environment, 
    to painless deploy using modular npm workflow. You’ll learn how to take full 
    advantage of using React with your backend, when a simple API client 
    architecture is not enough.
