  Title: Visualizing React
  Description: >
    Want to better understand the "magic" behind your React applications?
    We'll help uncover React's inner workings with three custom-built demos that
    highlight core react features in a visual way, to help developers truly
    "grok" what's happening under the hood of their React-backed applications.
    
    Demos will included visualizations and discussions around:
    - DOM Diffing: what's actually happening to your DOM?
    - Synthetic Events: how does object pooling work?
    - Data Flow: with examples using the Flux Dispatcher
  Length: 20

    I've been creating things on the web for more than 15 years, driven by a
    strong belief in the open web platform and enthusiasm for open source.
    As a front-end specialist with a full-stack background, I've come to greatly
    appreciate React's programming model for building robust application UIs,
    and want to help promote this simpler way of building apps for the web.
