  Title: Moving Fast: React and WebSockets
  Description: >
    At its core, React is all about building scalable and performant applications, especially when dealing
    with data that is constantly changing over time. If we consider a real-time application, where the client
    and server need to talk to each other constantly, that's when WebSockets come to mind - allowing a user's
    browser to open an interactive session with a server.
    
    Put React and WebSockets together and now we are moving fast. But are we moving too fast? Can the browser
    keep up with the constant flow of new data over time? Imagine a real-time dashboard built in React, being
    constantly fed data from Twitter's streaming API; how do you manage that?
    
    In this presentation we will be looking at how to best use React and WebSockets together to build really
    fast applications, while addressing all of the above questions.
