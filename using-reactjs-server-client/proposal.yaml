  Title: Reusing React.js Components on the Server and Client
  Description: >
    Application response time is very important.  Amazon estimates that a 100-millisecond delay reduces their sales by 1 percent.  By using server-side rendering with React.js, we can pre-render the initial state server-side which speeds up page loads dramatically since users don't have to wait for all the JavaScript to load before they see the page render.  React.js also lets us reuse these components client-side which reduces the amount of code we have to write and speeds up development.  In this talk, we'll take a detailed look at how to use components on both the server and client to achieve top performance.
