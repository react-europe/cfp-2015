  Title: React like it's 1999
  Description: >
    React is great for building rich JavaScript UIs in the browser, 
    but rendering HTML on the server is still a fact of life for many
    developers. Can React still be useful if we time-travel back to when
    server rendered HTML was the norm?

    We'll take a look at the murky, hostile environment that is the
    modern web browser, exploring the ways browser extensions, network 
    conditions & device capabilities can mess with your client side JavaScript.

    Then we'll examine the current server side templating landscape,
    looking closely at ease of development, testability & maintainability,
    and compare the existing options with rendering React components on
    the server.

    Finally we'll take a quick introductory tour of the world of isomorphic
    React, bringing together the slick UI of single page applications with
    the robustness & stability of server rendered HTML.

  bio: >
    Ben is a very tall Australian developer at who spends his days at Envato 
    building robust UIs for a massive community of developers & designers, 
    as well as constantly ranting to other developers about the benefits of 
    React, Flux & isomorphic JavaScript.

    At night you'll find him pushing experiments to GitHub, singing karaoke
    or enthusiastically planning a trip to a brand new city.
