  Title: Purify Mixins
  Description: >
    On npm, the ratio mixins to components is pretty high. So mixins are popular despite being poorly documented.

    Want to learn the possibilities, limitations and pitfalls of mixins?

    This talk explains what a mixin is and how it is different from a component. After defining a clear boundary,
    we will see how components and mixins are combined. Can we define all lifecycle methods in a mixin? What does
    it mean to have multiple mixins in one component? We will dive into React's source to get answers. Powerful
    visualizations and straightforward demos uncover mixin behavior in React.

    After this talk you will be able to write mixins with ease.
