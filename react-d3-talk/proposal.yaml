  Title: Reactive Visualizations: d3 meets React
  Description: >
    For many years, the dominant name in  client-side data visualizations has been d3.  And with good reason: d3 is a extraordinarily flexible and complete dataviz library.
    But all that power and flexibility comes with a cost: complexity.  Lots of developers struggle with d3's unfamiliar blend of declarative, imperative, and functional paradigms.  Additionally, d3 code re-use has traditionally presented a challenge.
    Fortunately, React can solve these two problems, and more. My talk will focus on how React provides a suitable framework for d3 visualizations.  I'll also discuss some the challenges we've run into integrating React with d3 in the open-source `react-d3` project, a rapidly growing collection of chart primitives. Using these primitives as building blocks, I'll walk through some example charts and other data visualizations.
    Finally, I'll discuss what a pure React data visualization framework might look like, and what advantages it might have over a hybrid project.
