  Title: "Beyond renderToString(): Optimizing Server Rendering"
  Description: >
    One of React's most alluring promises is that of isomorphic JavaScript through the use of React.renderToString(). 
    However, that's only the beginning of what we need to write server-side React that is truly fast for 
    our users. In this talk, we'll answer:
        * What are the performance bottlenecks with server-side React?
        * How can we parallelize browser painting and server rendering to make sure that time to first browser paint 
        is not blocked by React rendering?
        * How can we pipeline data to the client in an efficient way?
        * How can we make single-page applications that load code progressively while rendering server-side for first page load?
        * How will performance of server-side React rendering change as we move to HTTP/2?
    We will share both theoretical and practical tips we've learned over the course of implementing a framework
    for fast React server rendering, and we plan to open-source our framework in time for ReactEurope.
