  Title: DB-Backed UI's - Crazy Experiments, Tools, & Findings
  Description: >
    React pushed for simplicity so effectively, while staying so small, that it's enabled a whole new field of experiments in UI architecture. In this talk, we look at a Sul, a new way of managing state in a React client via a client-side in-memory, immutable database called DataScript. With Sul, instead of local state and multiple stores (normal React components & Flux) or narrowing scope (ClojureScript's Om components), we use database-queries against a single, centralize store power components. Multiple components with no structural ancestor relationship can query against a central store and derive custom views, and if a transaction invalidates the view, the components are independently re-rendered.
    Centralized stores and declarative db-queries also open up huge tooling possibilities - a designer can edit the query for a component in-browser and immediately see the change, entire user sessions can be captured and replayed for debugging and testing, and reusability falls out almost for free.
    No abstraction is without its tradeoffs, however. We'll also cover some of the disadvantages and challenges of this approach so far, with an eye towards future areas of exploration.

    Since founding Bushido, Sean Grove has started, contributed to, and maintains dozens of OSS projects, from Rails-based CRMs to reusable Om components. He laid the groundwork for the largest OSS Om app (CircleCI's frontend), has contributed reified keywords & polished source-map for the ClojureScript compiler, and has been keenly interested in improving dev & designer tooling in the browser, be they time-traveling debuggers or WebGL mockup tools. He also runs the ClojureScript meetup in SF.
