  Title: Building WordPress themes with React
  Description: >
    A REST API is currently being developed for WordPress and is due to be rolled into core at some
    point in 2015. (Although the REST API itself is already available as a plugin.) This will of
    course make it easier to develop more engaging JavaScript-based user experiences. Development of
    WordPress themes is due for an overhaul, and React might just be the answer.
    
    In many ways, React is the perfect partner to the presentation layer of WordPress. The comments
    section is an obvious area that can benefit. But who's to say that a whole theme shouldn't be
    built with React? If one thinks of WordPress as an app platform rather than just a blogging
    tool, the possibilites and use cases of React seem endless.
    
    Jack has been developing a new proposed starter theme for WordPress that is largely powered by
    React. This talk will cover the process involved, and challenges faced (both technically and
    politically), when building a JavaScript-based WordPress theme with React.
