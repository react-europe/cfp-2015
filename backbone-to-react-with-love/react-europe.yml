  Title: >
    Backbone to React with love.  How, why and what that can teach us.
  Description: >
    Do you have complex UI code? Performance issues? Is productivity a challenge? Learn how switching to React has helped Server Density solve these issues and why it's made me so very very happy. In this talk I will share 4 things. 1: How React solves the problems you will face with a long-running backbone code-base. 2: How you can gradually migrate to React whilst still shipping new features. 3: What our Backbone and React experiences can teach you about good code vs awesome code. 4: Direct comparisons of Backbone UI's vs React rewrites. This talk will share first hand experiences that prove that React is a solid choice for complex UI's. I can't wait.
