  Title: Animating with React
  Description: >
    Animations can turn a mundane functional interface into a fully immersive experience. 
    They make apps more intuitive and easier to navigate by helping users understand the 
    context of where they are within our applications. Especially since the introduction 
    of Material Design and Facebook’s Paper have expectations towards animations and transitions 
    only grown - and rightly so. 
    On the web platform, however, animations can quickly turn into an untestable setTimeout() nightmare.
    
    In this talk, I’ll cover how React gives us a unique advantage when animating because 
    it doesn't trash the DOM on state changes, re-rendering, or even navigation. 
    How can we utilize ReactTransitions to implement maintainable performative animations? 
    What are the pros and cons of animating with CSS, SVG, or element.animate() in React? 
    How best to animate draggable objects? And finally, how does React compare to ng-animate and famo.us?
