  Title: Towards universal component compatibility
  Description: >
    The JS community is suffering from a chronically fragmented open-source ecosystem. Third-party modules inspire a barrage of questions among developers: Is this what I want? Does it work? Is it reliable? Unfortunately, the common answer is “let’s roll our own”. Thousands of engineers have built amazing abstractions, yet we waste our time re-inventing vertical centering.
    Envision a future where web development is Lego: As the number of open-source components skyrockets, we have a standard way of sharing, typing, documenting, testing, and advertising components. Luckily, utopia is within reach! React's compact component API makes composition trivial. While this is a great start, further standardization is needed to allow universal composition and re-use.
    This talk examines how to make React components 100% composable and discoverable across the web, motivate the ecosystem to favor re-use over re-implementation, and how to ultimately lower the bar for participation in digital creation.
