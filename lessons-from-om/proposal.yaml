  Title: Lessons from Om with a Key to Plato
  Description: >
    One of the chief problems that React solves is the issue of knowledge about
    state. In Plato's _Theaetetus_, Socrates solves a similar problem: How do we
    distinguish knowledge that we have (ἔχω) from knowledge that we possess
    (κτάομαι)? The problem in both cases is compounded by the fact that
    knowledge — how a person looks or whether `on === true` — changes over time.

    In this talk, I want to show how Om (the ClojureScript interface to React)
    and core.async teach us about immutable data in ways that benefit even pure
    JavaScript applications. By focusing on Flux-y architectural patterns in
    pure JavaScript and in Om using core.async channels, I'll show that we know
    our data best not by keeping it from changing but by having justified true
    beliefs about its changes. I'll also demonstrate how we can use
    transducers to keep state comprehensible as it moves from actions to
    stores.

  bio: >
    Chuck is an engineer at Assembly, where he has led the move to a more
    reactive frontend architecture. He has yet to specialize, but he's had
    success focusing on making data easy to understand and reason about.

    Before turning to software development, Chuck studied flux and state in the
    dialogues of Plato.
