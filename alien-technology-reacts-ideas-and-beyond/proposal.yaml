    Alien Technology: React's Ideas and beyond
  Description: >
    An exploration of the ideas behind React and how it turned from _alien_ ("foreign") technology to _alien technology_ ("too good to be true"). What other alien artefacts are out there waiting to be discovered and harnessed in the lands of ClojureScript, Om, and Elm? What can React's reception history teach us to find the treasures more quickly?
    When React was released, most of all JSX _alienated_ people. Only when Pete Hunt helped us understand the ideas behind it, did we begin to realize React's potential. A paradigm shift began: from "the V in MVC" to a platform embracing simplicity - allowing it to support various rendering contexts and to be exploited by Om. What lessons can we learn from this transition to better judge new technology? To try out our new yard sticks, I'll give a tour of the alien territories with their immutable data structures, reference cursors, core.async, and FRP. We'll look at what can be used in React today and in what direction we should innovate.
