Session:
  Title: Reagent, a simple ClojureScript interface to React
  Description: >
    React and ClojureScript fit very well together. The
    Clojure(Script) community favors libraries over frameworks and
    React is such a library. React can leverage immutable data
    structures to gain more performance in shouldComponentUpdate. The
    immutable ClojureScript data structures are a perfect fit for
    this. Currently there are a couple of actively maintained
    ClojureScript interfaces to React: Om, Reagent and a couple of
    others. In this talk you will see how you can build an application
    with Reagent with limited knowledge of ClojureScript.
