Session:
  Title: Reagent, a simple ClojureScript interface to React
  Description: >
    React and ClojureScript fit very well together. The
    Clojure(Script) community favors libraries over frameworks and
    React is such a library. React can leverage immutable
    datastructures to gain more performance using
    shouldComponentUpdate. The immutable ClojureScript data structures
    are a perfect fit for this.  Currently there are a couple of
    actively maintained ClojureScript interfaces to React: Om, Reagent
    and a couple of others. In this talk you will see how you can
    build an application with Reagent.
