  Title: "Oh %$4#@, I Made It Slow. Performance Considerations When Implementing Inifinity Scrolling, Drag and Drop, and More"
  Description: >
    The React library makes it simple to build super performant apps, but issues can still arise at large scale.
    This session will explore React’s features which we can leverage to improve performance when jank rears its head, 
    and teach participants how to diagnose and resolve the performance issues which arise in large scale apps.

    We will use an example application that contains a series of overflow: scroll divs which have children components 
    that change parents, utilizing the React-DnD library. With a low number of dom nodes this will be quite performant, 
    but once we scale this to high numbers of dom nodes we’ll see an increase in screen delays/jank. Using Chrome’s 
    JavaScript timeline we will find the source of the jank we see in the interface and brainstorm multiple methods 
    for resolving the core issues. To resolve this, we’ll implement an infinity scrolling technique which demonstrates 
    the utility and power of React’s component lifecycle methods.
