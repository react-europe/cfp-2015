  Title: Rewriting React for Fun and Profit
  Description: >
    React provides a better, declarative interface for thinking about
    user interfaces, but most non-react interface libraries are mutable
    and stateful. How do we make these interop with our React code in
    sane ways?

    We'll cover some approaches to contain a single use of a mutable
    API to one component, but mostly focus on how to build a generic
    React interface around a mutable API, so that many components can
    use it without having to think about state manipulation.

    We'll walk through how we did this with our graphing library at
    Khan Academy, and how you can do it too!
