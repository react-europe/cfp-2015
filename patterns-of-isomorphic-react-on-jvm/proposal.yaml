  Title: Patterns of Isomorphic React on the JVM
  Description: >
    Sometimes developing modern JS apps can feel like we've taken two
    steps forward and one step back. SEO takes a hit, the initial load
    can be a pain for users, and progressive enhancement goes out the
    window. The prospect of rendering the JS app on the server and
    serving up HTML on the initial request promises to solve these
    problem.

    The JVM ships with a new JS runtime (Nashorn) that performs
    reasonably well, even compared to Node.js. It enables existing
    webapps on the JVM to benefit from server-side rendering. You can
    move your whole view layer into React. In this talk we'll explore
    patterns for running your React app on Nashorn. We'll discuss how to
    bundle up and load you JS into Nashorn, and some performance
    implications. We'll look at the Flux pattern and how to get data
    efficiently across language boundaries and into stores on the
    server. Finally we'll see how to get routing right in an isomorphic
    app.
