Session:
  Title: State of the State
  Description: >
    Designing long-running web applications, coming from request-response
    web development, is like a trusted friend developing a bipolar disorder.
    In both cases we have to deal with change at unexpected times and in
    unexpected ways.

    React is great, because it frees us from worrying about change at
    the view layer. But it doesn’t help us manage the state in other
    parts of our applications.

    This presentation will serve as an overview of the approaches for
    making state changes more manageable.

    Here are some of the questions we will discuss:
      - How can all parts of the app (components, remote requests, server pushes) communicate with the global state?
      - Where can we keep interaction state spanning more then one component?
      - Do we need local state at all and what are the trade-offs of using global state only?
      - What are some implementations of those approaches? Stores (flux), global heirarchical structures + cursors (Om, Morearty, Reagent), in-browser databases (DataScript, LokiJS).

    I am Nikolay, a Meta Enginner at Automattic, the company behind projects like WordPress.com, Gravatar, Simplenote, SocketIO, Longreads. Most of our new developments are single-page apps based on React and our REST API.

    I am very excited about building web applications in the browser. JavaScript, browsers, and web standards are evolving so quickly that we are forced to build our applications in a way that makes change easy. And that’s a challenge I love.
