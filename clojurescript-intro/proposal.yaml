  Title: Introduction to ClojureScript
  Description: >
    Over the last few years we have seen the rise of browser
    applications. Instead of rendering all UI server side, JavaScript
    driven client applications are now being widely adopted. While
    JavaScript is a flexible and powerful language, it has its
    shortcomings. This is where languages and tools that compile to
    JavaScript step in. ClojureScript is one of them and offers its
    own powerful features to the front end developer. In this talk you
    will get an overview of what ClojureScript development looks like
    and how it may simplify your application.
