Session:
  Title: Tracking Updates on Mutable Objects
  Description: >
    Immutable objects can provide huge performance gains when rendering
    React components. But what if you need to use mutable objects? Or 
    if you need to integrate with other JavaScript libraries that use 
    mutable objects?
    
    Learn how to track updates to mutable objects via an update engine
    to optimize the rendering of your React components without doing 
    deep object comparisons.
    
    In this talk, we'll explore:
    
     - Why mutable props can cause poor performance
     - How tracking updates to objects can help
     - How to build an update engine that tracks object updates
     - How to use this update engine to improve render performance

    This talk will teach you the lessons we've learned building an 
    update engine to optimize the rendering of large datasets in Amaze,
    a data visualization & discovery SDK we've built entirely on React.
