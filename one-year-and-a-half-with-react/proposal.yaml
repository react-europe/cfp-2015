Session:
  Title: One year and a half with React
  Description: >
    We've been using React since the very beginning of 2014 for a big multi-sites project.
    We were a team of consultants from different companies with different backgrounds (Java,
    Javascript, Scala, Clojure, HTML/CSS). When we assessed and choose React, we had no
    previous experience with it. We did not regret that choice.
    In this talk I will explain how we used React, from writing code to building, testing
    and scaling the development. I will share the challenges of code quality and code reuse
    we faced, and where React shines, and where it doesn't. I will show some of the pages we created
    and explain how React helped us achieve the results.

  bio: >
    Khalid Jebbari is a web developer with a love for open-source and knowledge sharing.
    Since he started working, with the Drupal PHP CMS, he got involved with the local Drupal Paris community.
    After leaving the Drupal world and getting seriously into Javascript, he now runs
    the monthly Paris.js meetup, where people gather to share all things Javascript.

    Khalid Jebbari thinks React is a real game changer in the way we develop web UIs,
    and after discovering Functional Programming and getting in love with Clojure(script),
    he's very happy to see the React and the ClojureScript communities sharing common ideas
    and pushing the web forward together.
