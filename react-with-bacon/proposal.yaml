  Title: Making React Reactive with Bacon
  Description: >
    React syncs the state of your components to the DOM. But what about syncing the state of your data to your components? Reactive programming using BaconJS is the perfect way to propagate changes from your data directly to your DOM and back again.
    This presentation will show how the reactive programing paradigm can help us greatly simplify the Flux architecture for fun and for profit.
